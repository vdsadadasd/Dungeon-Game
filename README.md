# Dungeon-Game

Welcome to my game repository.

It is a text-based adventure game where you play as a character trapped in a mysterious dungeon. Your objective is to escape by defeating the powerful Guardian that stalks the halls.

You navigate a grid-based dungeon (either 4x4 or 5x5, depending on difficulty), searching for weapons (a Bow and Arrows) and avoiding or confronting the Guardian. The game features turn-based movement, inventory management, and random events. You can attack the Guardian directly or use ranged attacks if you have the right items. The game ends when you defeat the Guardian or your health drops to zero.

Hints and atmospheric messages help guide you, and the game includes ASCII art and slow text effects for immersion.
